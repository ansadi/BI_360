# BUSINESS INSIGHTS 360

Businee Intelligence Project with Finance, Sales, Marketing & Supply Chain domain concepts dealing with FMCG Products

## Agenda:
To create one dashboard for all the departments(Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain) so that AtliQ Management can have Insights to make data driven decisions.

## Actions Undertaken:
Used PowerBI to import AtliQ Hardware database, and additional data in csv and .xlsx file format. Using Power Query Data was cleaned, transformed. 
Then Data modelling was completed.
After this I started creating Dashboard.
Live Interacting Dashboard was published into workspace and roles are assigned(Admin,Member,Contributor,Viewer) as per requirement.

## Pages In Dashboard:
* Info: Overview of AtliQ data
* Finance View: P & L statement for any customer /product / country or aggregation of the above over any time period and More..
* Sales View: customer performance analysis over key metrics like Net Sales, Gross Margin.
* Marketing View: Product performance analysis over key metrics like Net Sales, Gross Margin.Performance based on Region and segment.
* Supply Chain View: Analysis of Forecast Accuracy, Errors and Risk
* Executive View: Bird’s Eye View of KPI’s of AtliQ to generate Insights.
* Executive Request: Last minute Ad_hoc request by top executive.

## Business Metrics:

## Key Insights:
* Top Market: India leads in Net Sales($1271M) & Revenue Contribution(25.59%) but fall short of the GM%. Canada leads in GM(44.53%) 
* Top Customer: Amazon leads in Net Sales($460.37M) & Revenue Contribution(9.27%). But "Relief" which operates in Canada & Spain leads in GM(45.4%)

* AQ Marquee P4 is the worst product as per GM% growth YOY.
* With each Financial Year Forecast Accuracy is improving.
* Region Of Concern: Latin America Sales and Revenue Contribution is very poor.{ NS($21M) RC(0.42%) GM(34.74%) Tot COGS($13.7M) OperationalExpenses($16.5M) Other Expenses($0.12M) }
* Most Significant Market: India is best with Net Sales & Revenue Contribution, but still lags in GM% & Net Profit%.{ NS($1271M) RC(25.59%)  Tot COGS($828.96M) Oper. Expenses($1008.6M) Oth. Exp($7.6M) }
* Networking and Storage boasts good GM % and net profit % .  Management should actively increase the sales for N&S division.
* PC have highest Revenue Contribution. As Atliq is gaining market share in PC division, it should increase sales, but not at the cost of COGS, discount and Operational expenses.

## Overall Recomendation
*"Finally, AtliQ needs to control COGS, Operational Expenses and Discounts to get positive Net Profit%"**
