Businee Intelligence Project with Finance, Sales, Marketing & Supply Chain domain concepts dealing with FMCG Products

##Agenda:
To create one dashboard for all the departments(Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain) so that AtliQ Management can have Insights to make data driven decisions.

##Actions Undertaken:
Used PowerBI to import AtliQ Hardware database, and additional data in csv and .xlsx file format. Using Power Query Data was cleaned, transformed. 
Then Data modelling was completed.
After this I started creating Dashboard.
Live Interacting Dashboard was published into workspace and roles are assigned(Admin,Member,Contributor,Viewer) as per requirement.

##Pages In Dashboard:
• Info: Overview of AtliQ data

•	Market UK boasts highest GM%. 
•	With each Financial Year Forecast Accuracy is improving.
•	AQ HOME Allin1 Gen 2 is the best product as per Revenue Contribution and GM% growth YOY.
•	AQ Marquee P4 is the worst product as per GM% growth YOY. Atliq 
•	Latin America Sales and Revenue Contribution is very poor
•	Networking and Storage boasts good GM % and net profit % .  Management should actively increase the sales for N&S division.
